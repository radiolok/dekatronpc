# DekatronPC

A vacuum tube and cold-cathode tube based computer

## Dekatrons

Ð¡an do +1 and -1 operations by desing, so they are best devices for brainfuck instruction set.

As a next generation of BrainfuckPC, DekatronPC should have next characteristics:

* 8 instructions - pure brainfuck only without RLE;
* 1M Instruction Pointer counter;
* 30K Address Pointer Counter;
* 256 data counter;
* Harvard architecture;
* Up to 50kHz clock;
* RAM size - 30 000 bytes;
* RAM device - ferrite core memory;
